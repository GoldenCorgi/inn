A very good afternoon to everyone here in the spaceship. We are Team Poggers and, today we will be sharing on our solution - exoskeleton ai-enabled physiotherapy.

With me here today are my teammates, ys, lisa, callista, myself, chloe and qingyi. 

So, what is our problem statement? Physiotherapy is recommended for many injured athletes and military personnel by their doctors. However, it has low attendance and recovery rates, due to reasons like cost and effectiveness of their treatments. So, how can we aim to improve the recovery rate for injured patients while increasing retention rates for physiotherapy?

Before we start, I would like to share with you my experiences with physiotherapy. As seen in the pictures shown, I do pole vaulting competitively and suffer from stress fractures on my back. I attended physiotherapy with the intention to recover from my injuries but the lack of flexibility in the scheduling of the session stopped me from finishing my recovery sessions. 

Besides myself, yousheng, our other teammate also had experiences with physiotherapy to cure injuries due to a parachute training incident. He was less fortunate than me and had suffered fractures on his left leg and arm. Fortunately, his left arm managed to recover completely, but his leg is now permanently injured despite 1.5 years of physiotherapy. 
hence, we decided to work on this exoskeleton ai-enabled physiotherapy idea in hopes to increase the recovery rates of people who need it. 

To start, here is what we will be presenting today. First,  we would be talking about our solution plan which consists of the exoskeleton and the smart mirror. Next, we will bring you through the user journey and last, we will be sharing the business value of this idea and how we can bring revenue in.

There are many problems with traditional physiotherapy, and the top 3  are the Low Frequency, Short duration, Inflexible scheduling of the physiotherapy sessions.

Sessions are typically once a month, due to limited physiotherapists and clinics, and each session is very short, with only 30 minutes per session. And the slots are typically during working hours, as they are subjected to tight schedules of physiotherapists themselves.

For these 3 top problems, We aim to solve them using our solution - > EXO-AI

Using AI-enabled systems, integrated with Smart Mirror technology and Exoskeleton Robotics capabilities, we aim for remote physiotherapy sessions to be more convenient and effective for patients. EXO-AI can be placed at any military medical center or hospital, allowing for remote and flexible physiotherapy while promoting recovery at a faster and more flexible pace.

* next slide * 

Our solution consists of two main components - The exoskeleton, called EXO-S, and the Smart Mirror, called EXO-M. Both combined will be able to tackle our 3 problems effectively. Callista will now be explaining more about our first component, the EXO-S

# CALLISTA (45-50 seconds) (35s)
Moving on to EXO-S; our design consists of an Internet of Things-actuated wearable exoskeleton that integrates seamlessly with the EXO-Mirror. Using physical pressure and powered motion, it corrects your posture and increases your mobility during rehabilitation exercises.
*next slide*
Here, we have a blueprint of the exoskeleton. The device consists of 3 main parts – the upper body piece, lower body piece, and the waistband. The main components are the goniometers and actuators at key joints, which corrects your physical form using precise angular measurement and gentle pressure. The components are also able to gather data for personalization via reinforcement learning, which will then be sent over to the EXO-Mirror.
I will pass my time on to Chloe who will be talking more about the EXO-Mirror.

# CHLOE (1m04)
Our EXO-Mirror is an interactive smart mirror display screen, which serves as a user-friendly interface that gives immediate feedback during physiotherapy sessions. The user interactions will be done through hovering control, using gesture recognition technology.

* next slide * 

The system itself will be shared by many patients and will make use of biometrics facial recognition to authenticate users login

* next slide * 

Once users login, they can view their prescribed list of exercises and start their physiotherapy session

* next slide * 

During the sessions, detailed steps and user performance metrics, like the precision of the exercise done, will be shown. The user will just need to follow instructions and the demo shown on the mirror, making it a very intuitive process.

* next slide * 

When an incorrect form is done, the exoskeleton and the camera based pose estimation AI will detect this. The exoskeleton then applies pressure to correct the form, while the EXO-Mirror will show the exact position and give visual feedback on where the mistake is. Now Lisa will explain EXO-M’s smart features

# LISA (2 min 35) (3m)
For the EXO-M smart features, the key features include a personalized exercise plan, progress/ analysis report and augmented reality gamification. 
Why do we include these features?

Firstly, exercises assigned to the user might not be the most ideal for their current level or progress. Physiotherapists-prescribed exercises could be outdated by not taking into account the user’s capabilities at that very moment of exercise session. Therefore, having a personalized exercise plan using machine learning would help to mitigate this issue by using the past records and analysis of data to generate a plan for that session. 

*next slide*
This is the outline of our algorithm. The inputs into our model would be user details such as progress and medical history of the user. The output would be a routine consisting of information about the type of exercise, difficulty and number of repetitions.

*next slide*

Secondly, another problem we are solving is that users are often unaware of their progress in treatment and can only find out by asking their physiotherapists. We will thus provide progress and analysis reports by using easily accessible and comprehensive visualisations to show user’s progress in treatment. 

*next slide* 

This is an example of what the user will see on the smart mirror. There would be a time-based progress visualisation of their improvement to provide positive feedback and encouragement to the user as well as an in-depth report for each exercise session, which covers a recap of the sessions with regards to metrics such as positional accuracy. This is alongside a video playback which is provided by the camera functionality. 


*next slide* 

Additionally, not only can we benefit on the user-end, we can benefit physiotherapists who will get an overview of the extent to which the patient has recovered motor functions, to allow them to tweak and adjust the exercise based on the patient’s mobility to prevent overuse or overstrain of the affected muscle groups or even to speed up the recovery process. Upon clicking view more, they can see more in depth information with respect to the exercises such as positional accuracy.

*next slide* 
Lastly, another issue is that rehabilitation exercises are often repetitive and mundane, reducing motivation of patients and impeding their recovery rate. Therefore, we use Augmented reality-based gamification which simulates everyday items into a virtual environment for the user to exercise in a fun manner. 

*next slide* 

This is an example of a game we came up with. The user has to simulate moving ingredients to create a meal for customers. This is in comparison to alternatives such as virtual reality.  The user will then move it around to play a game, thus exercising in a gamified manner,

# QINGYI (~1 min 10 sec) (1m05)
To start off the user journey, the user will first schedule a free session with EXO-AI. Users can choose their preferred location, timing and duration based on their convenience.

Thereafter, a professional physiotherapist will pre-plan an exercise routine depending on the user’s specific requirements. An example would include recovery from military activity.

This can either be done before the user’s timeslot, or in real-time, depending on the physiotherapist.

*next slide* 

During the physiotherapy session with EXO-AI, the user will put on EXO-S, the wearable exoskeleton, and activate EXO-M, the smart mirror. The user can then access the step-by-step routine, with visual demos shown on EXO-M and active physical corrective action by EXO-S

Additionally, EXO-M will record the participant’s treatment, which can be viewed remotely by the physiotherapist at his convenience. This allows for an in-depth analysis of posture to provide better feedback for recovery.

Next, You Sheng will discuss the business value of our solution.


# You Sheng (2m)

For the current physiotherapy market, we have 2 main contenders, traditional physiotherapy and exoskeleton physiotherapy. For exoskeleton physiotherapy, like ReWalk, they are typically focused only on one set of actions, like walking. And their exoskeleton will require a physiotherapist on the scene helping them at the same time, which still limits the amount of scheduling flexibility. This also means that it is weaker than traditional physiotherapy as they are not able to cater for multiple limb injuries and different exercises for individuals. 

* next slide * 
Our solution comes above both of them, by allowing scheduling flexibility via our remote collaboration in our EXO Smart Mirror, and yet still providing the personalised tailored exercises that a traditional physiotherapy can do.

But how big is the market for physiotherapy? Physiotherapy itself is a huge billion dollar industry, but let’s zoom in to one of our target audience, the military personnel in U.S. A huge 65% of military soldiers suffer injuries and 70% are due to poor form and stress that could be easily prevented via proper physiotherapy methods. This injuries lead to increased costs in permanent disability compensation as well.

* next slide * 

And the medical costs come up to $ 434 million dollars per year in the U.S military alone, without factoring in permanent disability compensation.

* next slide * 

On the individual level, each session in Singapore costs about $80 to $300 dollars, and with an average of 8 sessions, comes up to a total of around $700 to $2500. This makes physiotherapy a larger medical expense for injured athletes and military personnel. 

Our solution aims to enter this huge market, and ultimately improve the lives of injured patients all over the world.

Ladies and gentleman, I present to you our solution - EXO AI, Reimagining Physiotherapy for the future. 


Thank you
