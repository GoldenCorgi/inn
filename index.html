        <p class="lead">A very good afternoon to everyone here in the spaceship. We are Team Poggers and, today we will be sharing on our solution - exoskeleton ai-enabled physiotherapy.
          <br><br>          With me here today are my teammates, ys, lisa, callista, myself, chloe and qingyi. 
          <br><br>          So, what is our problem statement? Physiotherapy is recommended for many injured athletes and military personnel by their doctors. However, it has low attendance and recovery rates, due to reasons like cost and effectiveness of their treatments. So, how can we aim to improve the recovery rate for injured patients while increasing retention rates for physiotherapy?
          <br><br>          Before we start, I would like to share with you my experiences with physiotherapy. As seen in the pictures shown, I do pole vaulting competitively and suffer from stress fractures on my back. I attended physiotherapy with the intention to recover from my injuries but the lack of flexibility in the scheduling of the session stopped me from finishing my recovery sessions. 
          <br><br>          Besides myself, yousheng, our other teammate also had experiences with physiotherapy to cure injuries due to a parachute training incident. He was less fortunate than me and had suffered fractures on his left leg and arm. Fortunately, his left arm managed to recover completely, but his leg is now permanently injured despite 1.5 years of physiotherapy. 
          hence, we decided to work on this exoskeleton ai-enabled physiotherapy idea in hopes to increase the recovery rates of people who need it. 
          <br><br>          To start, here is what we will be presenting today. First,  we would be talking about our solution plan which consists of the exoskeleton and the smart mirror. Next, we will bring you through the user journey and last, we will be sharing the business value of this idea and how we can bring revenue in.
