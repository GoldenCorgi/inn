        <p class="lead">Thanks Joey. Now, there are many problems with traditional physiotherapy, and the top 3  are the Low Frequency, Short duration, Inflexible scheduling of the physiotherapy sessions.
          <br><br>

          Sessions are typically once a month, due to limited physiotherapists and clinics, and each session is very short, with only 30 minutes per session. And the slots are typically during working hours, as they are subjected to tight schedules of physiotherapists themselves.
          </p><hr><p class="lead">
          For these 3 top problems, We aim to solve them using our solution - > EXO-AI
          <br><br>

          Using AI-enabled systems, integrated with Smart Mirror technology and Exoskeleton Robotics capabilities, we aim for remote physiotherapy sessions to be more convenient and effective for patients. EXO-AI can be placed at any military medical center or hospital, allowing for remote and flexible physiotherapy while promoting recovery at a faster and more flexible pace.
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          Our solution consists of two main components - The exoskeleton, called EXO-S, and the Smart Mirror, called EXO-M. Both combined will be able to tackle our 3 problems effectively. Callista will now be explaining more about our first component, the EXO-S
