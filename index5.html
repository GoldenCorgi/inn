          For the EXO-M smart features, the key features include a personalized exercise plan, progress/ analysis report and augmented reality gamification. 
          Why do we include these features?
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          Firstly, exercises assigned to the user might not be the most ideal for their current level or progress. Physiotherapists-prescribed exercises could be outdated by not taking into account the user’s capabilities at that very moment of exercise session. Therefore, having a personalized exercise plan using machine learning would help to mitigate this issue by using the past records and analysis of data to generate a plan for that session. 
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          This is the outline of our algorithm. The inputs into our model would be user details such as progress and medical history of the user. The output would be a routine consisting of information about the type of exercise, difficulty and number of repetitions.
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          
          Secondly, another problem we are solving is that users are often unaware of their progress in treatment and can only find out by asking their physiotherapists. We will thus provide progress and analysis reports by using easily accessible and comprehensive visualisations to show user’s progress in treatment. 
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          
          This is an example of what the user will see on the smart mirror. There would be a time-based progress visualisation of their improvement to provide positive feedback and encouragement to the user as well as an in-depth report for each exercise session, which covers a recap of the sessions with regards to metrics such as positional accuracy. This is alongside a video playback which is provided by the camera functionality. 
          
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          
          Additionally, not only can we benefit on the user-end, we can benefit physiotherapists who will get an overview of the extent to which the patient has recovered motor functions, to allow them to tweak and adjust the exercise based on the patient’s mobility to prevent overuse or overstrain of the affected muscle groups or even to speed up the recovery process. Upon clicking view more, they can see more in depth information with respect to the exercises such as positional accuracy.
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          Lastly, another issue is that rehabilitation exercises are often repetitive and mundane, reducing motivation of patients and impeding their recovery rate. Therefore, we use Augmented reality-based gamification which simulates everyday items into a virtual environment for the user to exercise in a fun manner. 
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          This is an example of a game we came up with. The user has to simulate moving ingredients to create a meal for customers. This is in comparison to alternatives such as virtual reality.  The user will then move it around to play a game, thus exercising in a gamified manner,
