          To start off the user journey, the user will first schedule a free session with EXO-AI. Users can choose their preferred location, timing and duration based on their convenience.
          <br><br>

          Thereafter, a professional physiotherapist will pre-plan an exercise routine depending on the user’s specific requirements. An example would include recovery from military activity.
          <br><br>

          This can either be done before the user’s timeslot, or in real-time, depending on the physiotherapist.

          During the physiotherapy session with EXO-AI, the user will put on EXO-S, the wearable exoskeleton, and activate EXO-M, the smart mirror. The user can then access the step-by-step routine, with visual demos shown on EXO-M and active physical corrective action by EXO-S
          <br><br>

          Additionally, EXO-M will record the participant’s treatment, which can be viewed remotely by the physiotherapist at his convenience. This allows for an in-depth analysis of posture to provide better feedback for recovery.
