          For the current physiotherapy market, we have 2 main contenders, traditional physiotherapy and exoskeleton physiotherapy. For exoskeleton physiotherapy, like ReWalk, they are typically focused only on one set of actions, like walking. And their exoskeleton will require a physiotherapist on the scene helping them at the same time, which still limits the amount of scheduling flexibility. This also means that it is weaker than traditional physiotherapy as they are not able to cater for multiple limb injuries and different exercises for individuals. 

        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          Our solution comes above both of them, by allowing scheduling flexibility via our remote collaboration in our EXO Smart Mirror, and yet still providing the personalised tailored exercises that a traditional physiotherapy can do.
          <br><br>

          But how big is the market for physiotherapy? Physiotherapy itself is a huge billion dollar industry, but letâ€™s zoom in to one of our target audience, the military personnel in U.S. A huge 65% of military soldiers suffer injuries and 70% are due to poor form and stress that could be easily prevented via proper physiotherapy methods. This injuries lead to increased costs in permanent disability compensation as well.
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          
          And the medical costs come up to $ 434 million dollars per year in the U.S military alone, without factoring in permanent disability compensation.
          
        </p><hr><p class="lead">
          
          On the individual level, each session in Singapore costs about $80 to $300 dollars, and with an average of 8 sessions, comes up to a total of around $700 to $2500. This makes physiotherapy a larger medical expense for injured athletes and military personnel. 
          <br><br>
          Our solution aims to enter this huge market, and ultimately improve the lives of injured patients all over the world.
